# Summary

This Lightrun on AWS workshop was a comprehensive introduction to the our powerful developer observability tool. Participants learned about the various capabilities of Lightrun, including its ability to dynamically log running applications, diagnose production issues and provide insight into how the application behaves in practice. Throughout the workshop, attendees were able to work hands-on with the tool and gain a deeper understanding of how it can be used to understand the behavior of live applications.

The workshop covered the basics of setting up Lightrun in an AWS setting, as well as using it in practice to observe applications in real-tim and resolve issues that arise in them.
