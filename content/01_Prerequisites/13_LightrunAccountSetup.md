Note that if your topology requires single-tenant, private cloud or on-prem deployments (whether airgapped or not), this workshop still applies to you!
[Contact us](https://lightrun.com/request-a-demo) for more information on how to setup Lightrun in your own environment.

Note that there are two installation options - using the [JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/16477-lightrun) or via a manual installation. Both will yield the same result, choose whichever you're more comfortable with.

4. In the next screen, download the **Linux** version of the Lightrun SDK (formerly known as the Lightrun agent) that will be added to our Docker container later. There is **no need to run the application with the agent** - we'll take care of this later on.

Regardless of which operating system you're working on, this workshop focuses on running our Java application on Linux containers. Please make sure to only use the Linux version of the SDK to avoid any incompatibilities.

1. Note that the Next button will be greyed out, requesting that you run your app with the Lightrun SDK in order to continue. This is fine, and we'll take care of it later on.
