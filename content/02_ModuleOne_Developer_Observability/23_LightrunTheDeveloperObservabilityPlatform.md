# Lightrun - The Developer Observability Platform

To make it easier for developers to keep track of their live applications, we should create a process that lets them access the information they need without making them change their usual tools and practices.

The new process should have the following features:

* Real-time: Quick answers are important, so the process should let developers ask questions and get immediate answers, just like Snyk's real-time security alerts in the IDE.

* No ops required: Developers shouldn't have to rely on ops or know all the details about the persistence layer to understand the state of their applications. They should be able to easily find the information they need in the dashboarding system.

* Developer-friendly: Dashboards with lots of information can be overwhelming, so the process should put the data developers need right where they're working, like next to the lines of code. This way, they can see how their code is actually working without having to switch to another tool or understand complex operational processes.

* Cost-effective: Logging costs money, so the process should focus on logging exactly what's needed, when it's needed, instead of having hardcoded logs and metrics from development. This way, we can save money by avoiding the costs of storing and analyzing unnecessary information.

Lighrun’s Developer Observability Platform allows backend engineers, DevOps Engineers and SREs to add dynamic logs, metrics and snapshots to live applications - in real time and on-demand. By replacing costly, non-agile and iterative logging & observability processes with developer-native, IDE-based dynamic workflows, Lightrun’s customers enjoy improved developer productivity, reduced MTTR and drastically lower logging and monitoring bills.
